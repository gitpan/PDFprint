PDFprint is a very flexible tool to print PDF files from different directories
and recursively from every subdirectories (in the future, form FTP and
HTTP sites) to a printer or to the monitor, in PostScript format or in text
format. 

At the moment, if you want to print a PDF file you need a tool that converts it
in PostScript format (level 3 PostScript printers will accept PDF format
directly). Usually, the tool is a reader, so you have to visualize the PDF file,
then the tool converts it in a PostScript file and sends the PostScript file to
the printer.
How can you print the first page of every PDF file, starting with "a" letter, in
your archive?
How can you read the first page of every PDF file in your archive?
With PDFprint you can solve these problems.
