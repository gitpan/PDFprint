At the moment, if you want to print a PDF file you need a tool that converts it
in a PostScript file (printer with PostScript version 3 will accept PDF format
directly). Usually, the tool is a reader so you have to visualize the PDF file,
then you can convert it in a PostScript file and send the PostScript file to
the printer.
How can you print the first page of all your PDF files in your archive?
With PDFprint you can solve this problem.
PDFprint is a very flexible script. It requires PERL 5.xxx and the script pdf2ps
of Ghostscript 5.xx distribution (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/) or better
pdftops (pdftotext if you don't have a PostScript printer) included in xpdf tool
(http://www.aimnet.com/~derekn/xpdf/).

If you use pdftotext with pg or more you can use PDFprint like a PDF ascii
reader. You can ask to this question: how can I read the first page of all
my PDF files in my archive?
