poster - Scale and tile a postscript image to print on
multiple pages

<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1"><B>Synopsis</B></A></H2>

<P>
poster &lt;options&gt; infile

<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><B>Description</B></A></H2>

<P>
<I>Poster</I> can be used to create a large poster by building it
from multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It
expects as input a generic (encapsulated) postscript file,
normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
postscript file, maybe containing multiple pages together
building the poster. The output pages bear cutmarks and
have slightly overlapping images for easier assembling. The
input picture will be scaled to obtain the desired size.
<P>
The program uses a brute-force method: it copies the entire
input file for each output page, hence the output file can
be very large. Since the program does not really bother
about the input file contents, it clearly works for both
black-and-white and color postscript.
<P>
To control its operation, you need to specify either the
size of the desired poster or a scale factor for the image:

<DL>

<DT>- Given the poster size, it calculates the required number</DT></DT>
<DD>
of sheets to print on, and from that a scale factor to
fill these sheets optimally with the input image.
</DD>

<DT>- Given a scale factor, it derives the required number of</DT></DT>
<DD>
pages from the input image size, and positions the scaled
image centered on this area.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Its input file should best be a real `Encapsulated
Postscript' file (often denoted with the extension .eps or
.epsf). Such files can be generated from about all current
drawing applications, and text processors like Word,
Interleaf and Framemaker.<BR>

However <I>poster</I> tries to behave properly also on more
relaxed, general postscript files containing a single page
definition. Proper operation is obtained for instance on
pages generated by (La)TeX and (g)troff.
<P>
The media to print on can be selected independently from the
input image size and/or the poster size. <I>Poster</I> will
determine by itself whether it is beneficial to rotate the
output image on the media.
<P>
To preview the output results of <I>poster</I> and/or to (re-)print
individual output pages, you should use a postscript
previewer like <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man2html?ghostview&1">ghostview(1)</A>
.

<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>Options</B></A></H2>

<P>
-v Be verbose. Tell about scaling, rotation and number of
pages.<BR>

Default is silent operation.

<DL>

<DT>-f Ask manual media feed on the plotting/printing device,</DT></DT>
<DD>
instead of using its standard paper tray.
Default is adhering to the device settings.
</DD>

<DT>-i &lt;box&gt;</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify the size of the input image.
Default is reading the image size from the
`%%BoundingBox' specification in the input file header.
</DD>

<DT>-m &lt;box&gt;</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify the desired media size to print on. See below for
&lt;box&gt;.
The default is set at compile time, being A4 in the
standard package.
</DD>

<DT>-p &lt;box&gt;</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify the poster size. See below for &lt;box&gt;. Since
<I>poster</I> will autonomously choose for rotation, always
specify a `portrait' poster size (i.e. higher then wide).
If you don't give the -s option, the default poster size
is identical to the media size.
</DD>

<DT>-s &lt;number&gt;</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify a linear scaling factor to produce the poster.
Together with the input image size and optional margins,
this induces an output poster size. So don't specify both
-s and -p.
Default is deriving the scale factor to fit a given
poster size.
</DD>

<DT>-c &lt;box&gt; <I>or</I> -c &lt;number&gt;%</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify the cut margin. This is the distance between the
cutmarks and the paper edge. If the output is really
tiled on multiple sheets, the cut marks indicate where to
cut the paper for assembly. This margin must be big
enough to cover the non-printable margin which almost all
printers have. For &lt;box&gt; see below.
Default is 5%. Only when you specify identical poster and
media sizes, the default cut margin becomes 0,
effectively removing the cutmarks.
</DD>

<DT>-w &lt;box&gt; <I>or</I> -w &lt;number&gt;%</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify a white margin around the output image.
In the `ideal' situation (when an input `eps' file
specifies an exact BoundingBox in its header), the output
image will be scaled exactly to the edges of the
resulting poster (minus cut margin). If you desire a
certain margin to remain around the picture after poster
assembly, you can specify this with `-w'.
(This option is actually redundant, since you can obtain
the same result using -s or -i. However some might find
this more convenient.)
Default is 0.
</DD>

<DT>-o &lt;outputfile&gt;</DT></DT>
<DD>
Specify the name of the file to write the output into.
(Only added for those poor people who cannot specify
output redirection from their command line due to a silly
OS.)
Default is writing to standard output.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
The &lt;box&gt; mentioned above is a specification of horizontal
and vertical size. Only in combination with the `-i'
option, the program also understands the offset
specification in the &lt;box&gt;.<BR>

In general:<BR>

&lt;box&gt; = [&lt;multiplier&gt;][&lt;offset&gt;]&lt;unit&gt;
with multipier and offset being specified optionally.
&lt;multiplier&gt; = &lt;number&gt;*&lt;number&gt;<BR>

&lt;offset&gt; = +&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;<BR>

&lt;unit&gt; = &lt;medianame&gt; or &lt;distancename&gt;
<P>
Many international media names are recognised by the
program, in upper and lower case, and can be shortened to
their first few characters, as long as unique. For instance
`A0', `Let'.<BR>

Distance names are like `cm', `i', `ft'.

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><B>Examples</B></A></H2>

<P>
The following command prints an A4 input file on 8 A3 pages,
forming an A0 poster:<BR>

poster -v -iA4 -mA3 -pA0 infile &gt;outfile
<P>
The next command prints an eps input image on a poster of
3x3 Letter pages:<BR>

poster -v -mLet -p3x3Let image.eps &gt; outfile
<P>
The next command enlarges an eps input image to print on a
large-media A0 capable device, maintaining 2 inch margins:
poster -v -mA0 -w2x2i image.eps &gt; outfile
<P>
Enlarge a postscript image exactly 4 times, print on the
default A4 media, and let <I>poster</I> determine the number of
pages required:<BR>

poster -v -s4 image.eps &gt; outfile
<P>
Scale a postscript image to a poster of about 1 square
meter, printing on `Legal' media, maintaining a 10% of
`Legal' size as white margin around the poster.
poster -v -mLegal -p1x1m -w10% infile.ps &gt;outfile

If your input file contains -or consists of- pixel images
(as opposed to just vector data which is essentially
resolution independent), you might have this problem. Such
pixel images are normally made to fit well to standard 300
(or 600) dpi devices. Scaling such a picture with an
uncarefully chosen factor, can easily lead to hazy edges and
interference patterns on the output. The solution is to
provide <I>poster</I> with an exact scaling factor (with the -s
option), chosen as an integer. If integer scaling is
unpractical for your purpose, choose a fractional number
made from a small integer denominator (2, 3, 4).
<P>
<B>Can</B> <B>I</B> <B>select</B> <B>only</B> <B>a</B> <B>small</B> <B>part</B> <B>of</B> <B>a</B> <B>given</B> <B>input</B> <B>picture?</B>
Yes, for this purpose you can define both the size (width
and height) and offset (from left and bottom) of a window on
the input image. Specify these numbers as argument to a `i'
command line option.<BR>

One way to obtain such numbers is previewing the original
image with ghostview, and observing the coordinate numbers
which it continually displays. These numbers are in
postscript units (points), named by <I>poster</I> as just `p'.
<P>
<B>Poster</B> <B>doesn't</B> <B>seem</B> <B>to</B> <B>work</B> <B>properly,</B> <B>output</B> <B>pages</B> <B>are</B> <B>empty</B>
The major cause for poster not to work correctly, is giving
it postscript files which don't conform to proper `eps'
behaviour. Try whether your application (or printer driver)
cannot generate real `encapsulated postscript'.
<P>
<B>If</B> <B>I</B> <B>ask</B> <B>for</B> <B>a</B> <B>50x50cm</B> <B>poster,</B> <B>it</B> <B>always</B> <B>generates</B> <B>something</B>
<B>bigger</B><BR>

Yes, probably. When specifying a desired output size with
the `-p' option, <I>poster</I> first determines an array of sheets
to cover such an area. Then it determines a scale factor
for the picture to fill these sheets upto their edge. As
result your requested size is used as rough guess only. If
you want an exact output size, specify the scaling factor
yourself with the `-s' option (and omit the `-p').
<P>
<B>I</B> <B>want</B> <B>to</B> <B>keep</B> <B>the</B> <B>white</B> <B>space</B> <B>around</B> <B>the</B> <B>poster</B> <B>as</B> <B>in</B> <B>my</B>
<B>original</B><BR>

<I>Poster</I> will as default use the input image bounding box, and
scale/translate that to the edges of your poster. If the
program which generated your input file specifies an exact
and tight %%BoundingBox, you will indeed loose your white
margin. To keep the original margin, specify a `-i' option
with as argument the papersize on which the original
document was formatted (such as `-iA4'). Alternatively
specify a smaller scale factor (with -s) or an explicit new
margin (with -w).

<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><B>Poster</B> <B>Assembly</B></A></H2>

<P>
Our preferred method for the assembly of a poster from
multiple sheets is as follows:

<DL>

<DT>- Arrange the sheets in the proper order on a large table or</DT></DT>
<DD>
on the floor.
</DD>

<DT>- Remove from all sheets, except from those in the leftmost</DT></DT>
<DD>
column or bottom row, their left and bottom cutmargin.
</DD>

<DT>- In left-to-right and bottom-to-top order, glue the right</DT></DT>
<DD>
(and top) cutmargin and stick the right (and upper)
neighbouring page on top of that.
</DD>

<DT>- Turn the glued-together poster face bottom, and put</DT></DT>
<DD>
adhesive tape on the sheet edges (on the backside of the
poster) for more strength.
</DD>

<DT>- Remove the remaining cutmargin around the poster.</DT></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>Device</B> <B>Settings</B></A></H2>

<P>
For postscript level-2 capable printers/plotters, which is
about all modern postscript devices today, <I>poster</I> will send
device settings in its output file. This consists of a
`setpagedevice' call, setting:

<DL>

<DT>- the media size.</DT></DT>
<DD>
This is required for all printers I know to get correct
behaviour on different media/picture sizes.
</DD>

<DT>- duplexing off.</DT></DT>
<DD>
Some printers will otherwise perform double-side printing
by default. Clearly that is not what you want to print a
poster.
</DD>

<DT>- manual media feed.</DT></DT>
<DD>
This is given only when <I>poster</I> was executed with the `-f'
command line option. This is a convenient feature if you
want to print your job on different media than normally
installed in the paper tray, and you are submitting your
job through a multi-user networking and spooling
environment.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
These settings cause proper device behaviour, without the
need to manually interact with the printer settings, and has
been here locally tested to work on devices like the HP300XL
and HP650C.
<P>
The settings thus passed in the postscript file, will affect
the device for this job only.

<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8"><B>Dsc</B> <B>Conformance</B></A></H2>

<P>
<I>Poster</I> will generate its own DSC header and other DSC lines
in the output file, according the `Document Structuring
Conventions - version 3.0', as written down in the
`Postscript Language Reference Manual, 2nd ed.' from Adobe
Systems Inc, Addison Wesley Publ comp., 1990.
<P>
It will copy any `%%Document...' line from the input file
DSC header to its own header output. This is used here in
particular for required nonresident fonts.
<P>
However the copy(s) of the input file included in the
output, are stripped from all lines starting with a `%',
since they tend to disturb our `ghostview' previewer and
take useless space anyhow.
