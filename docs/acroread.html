    -toPostScript [options]
        Converts the given pdf_files to PostScript.

        In the first form, if the last file specified is a directory,
        then all preceding files will be converted to PostScript
        and the generated PostScript files will be placed into ps_dir.
        If a directory is not specified, then the PostScript files
        will be placed in the same directory as the original file.

        In the second form, the file list contains pairs, each
        consisting of a PDF filename and a corresponding PostScript
        filename.

        The third form specifies a filter, reading a PDF file from
        standard input and writing the PostScript file to standard
        output.

        The following are valid options for the conversion of PDF to
        PostScript:

        -level2 - emit Level 2 PostScript (default is Level 1 PostScript)
    -xrm <X resource specification>
        Standard X Window System resource specification on command line.
